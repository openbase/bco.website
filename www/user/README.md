## BCozy (Desktop Application)
[![GUI Overview](/images/bcozy/bcozy_gui_overview.png)](bcozy.md)
Managing your devices in a menu structure is a well known approach but can end up really bad when dealing with too many entries and levels.
Since inhabitants are perfectly familiar with the physical structure of their environment we thought about using such a representation for management and control purposes.
Therefore, we developed BCozy to organize and control your smart environment via a 2D map.

## BComfy (Android App)
[![GUI Overview](/images/bcomfy/2_interact_3.jpg)](bcomfy.md)
This Android app can be used to create a 3D representation of your environment.
When scanning your rooms and your devices, their shape and arrangement are stored within the bco database.
Afterwards this information is used as the baseline for automation routines and visualization purposes.
Once the 3D information is available, BComfy augments the smartphone camera view with virtual control elements.
This augmented reality interface is especially useful to maintain your environment.
Checkout battery levels and sensor events in realtime while walking through your home.

::: tip INFO
Because the augmented reality framework is build on top of Google Tango, BCozy is currently limited to Android devices with Tango support. Developers with knowledge about AR Core are highly welcome to join our taskforce to port BComfy to the AR Core Framework.

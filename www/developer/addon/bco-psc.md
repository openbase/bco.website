# BCO Pointing Smart Control

 Control your environment via pointing gestures. Technically, this addon maps pointing gestures onto operation services of BCO. Once a person points onto a BCO Unit which is offering one of the mapped operation services, those are controlled depending on the type of gesture. Details about PSC can be found within the following [setup description](https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/csra/nightly/components/pointing_smart_control.html).

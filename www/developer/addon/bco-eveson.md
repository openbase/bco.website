# BCO Eveson

In smart environments, a myriad of sensors and processing components produce a very large amount of data every second. We implemented the framework Eveson which supports the monitoring through the generation of pleasant ambient soundscapes based on such complex data streams.

Eveson supports the individual selection of data streams and types and the configuration of how they should be sonified. The bundle of all data to sound mappings is stored in a theme configuration. For your prototype we especially selected only sounds of one natural environment (the German forest) to generate a familiar soundscape for the user.
